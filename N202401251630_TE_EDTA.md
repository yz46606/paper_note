# Background

benchmark around 25 repeat annotaton package, and selected the 6 general and structure based and 1 database similarity based softwares and built a pipeline call EDTA for intact TE annotation.
the annotated TE include retrotransposons LTR and non-LTR (LINEs SINEs),  and DNA transponsons, TIRs, MITEs, Helitrons
