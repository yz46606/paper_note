# Paper reading summary
using adaptor and library techque to link the both stand of the dna sequence toghether into one sequence, then feed to NGS sequence, mutation that apear twice in a concatenating sequence will be regard as true mutation.
this scratergy is used to suppress the false positive of mutation discovery.
